what's open on campus??

One of the most daunting issues that fall upon college students during the early morning hours is studying on an empty stomach; a lot of this time is wasted searching for a snack from the limited number of places that are open. At first, we decided to target this issue and develop an app that would facilitate the midnight hunt. This slowly expanded to a user interface that would intuitively display campus buildings that are open, near closing, or closed. The simplicity of the app provides informative, yet easy and quick access to data that soves an issue that many college students encounter.
